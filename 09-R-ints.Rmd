#  GUI consoles
<p>The standard R front-ends are programs which run in a terminal, but there are several ways to provide a GUI console.</p>
<p>This can be done by a package which is loaded from terminal-based R and launches a console as part of its startup code or by the user running a specific function: package <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcmdr"><strong>Rcmdr</strong></a> is a well-known example with a Tk-based GUI.</p>
<p>There used to be a Gtk-based console invoked by <code class="calibre2">R --gui=GNOME</code>: this relied on special-casing in the front-end shell script to launch a different executable. There still is <code class="calibre2">R --gui=Tk</code>, which starts terminal-based R and runs <code class="calibre2">tcltk::tkStartGui()</code> as part of the modified startup sequence.</p>
<p>However, the main way to run a GUI console is to launch a separate program which runs embedded R: this is done by <code class="calibre2">Rgui.exe</code> on Windows and <code class="calibre2">R.app</code> on macOS. The first is an integral part of R and the code for the console is currently in R.dll.</p>

<h3 id="r.app" class="section">7.1 R.app</h3>
<p><code class="calibre2">R.app</code> is a macOS application which provides a console. Its sources are a separate project<a href="concept-index.html#FOOT21" id="DOCF21"><sup>21</sup></a>, and its binaries link to an R installation which it runs as a dynamic library libR.dylib. The standard CRAN distribution of R for macOS bundles the GUI and R itself, but installing the GUI is optional and either component can be updated separately.</p>
<p><code class="calibre2">R.app</code> relies on libR.dylib being in a specific place, and hence on R having been built and installed as a Mac macOS ‘framework’. Specifically, it uses /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/R. This is a symbolic link, as frameworks can contain multiple versions of R. It eventually resolves to /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/lib/libR.dylib, which is (in the CRAN distribution) a ‘fat’ binary containing multiple sub-architectures.</p>
<p>macOS applications are directory trees: each <code class="calibre2">R.app</code> contains a front-end written in Objective-C for one sub-architecture: in the standard distribution there are separate applications for 32- and 64-bit Intel architectures.</p>
<p>Originally the R sources contained quite a lot of code used only by the macOS GUI, but this was migrated to the <code class="calibre2">R.app</code> sources.</p>
<p><code class="calibre2">R.app</code> starts R as an embedded application with a command-line which includes --gui=aqua (see below). It uses most of the interface pointers defined in the header Rinterface.h, plus a private interface pointer in file src/main/sysutils.c. It adds an environment it names <code class="calibre2">tools:RGUI</code> to the second position in the search path. This contains a number of utility functions used to support the menu items, for example <code class="calibre2">package.manager()</code>, plus functions <code class="calibre2">q()</code> and <code class="calibre2">quit()</code> which mask those in package <strong>base</strong>—the custom versions save the history in a way specific to <code class="calibre2">R.app</code>.</p>
<p>There is a <code class="calibre2">configure</code> option --with-aqua for R which customizes the way R is built: this is distinct from the --enable-R-framework option which causes <code class="calibre2">make install</code> to install R as the framework needed for use with <code class="calibre2">R.app</code>. (The option --with-aqua is the default on macOS.) It sets the macro <code class="calibre2">HAVE_AQUA</code> in config.h and the make variable <code class="calibre2">BUILD_AQUA_TRUE</code>. These have several consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code class="calibre2">quartz()</code> device is built (other than as a stub) in package <strong>grDevices</strong>: this needs an Objective-C compiler. Then <code class="calibre2">quartz()</code> can be used with terminal R provided the latter has access to the macOS screen.</li>
<li>File src/unix/aqua.c is compiled. This now only contains an interface pointer for the <code class="calibre2">quartz()</code> device(s).</li>
<li><code class="calibre2">capabilities(&quot;aqua&quot;)</code> is set to <code class="calibre2">TRUE</code>.</li>
<li>The default path for a personal library directory is set as ~/Library/R/x.y/library.</li>
<li>There is support for setting a ‘busy’ indicator whilst waiting for <code class="calibre2">system()</code> to return.</li>
<li><code class="calibre2">R_ProcessEvents</code> is inhibited in a forked child from package <strong>parallel</strong>. The associated callback in <code class="calibre2">R.app</code> does things which should not be done in a child, and forking forks the whole process including the console.</li>
<li>There is support for starting the embedded R with the option --gui=aqua: when this is done the global C variable <code class="calibre2">useaqua</code> is set to a true value. This has consequences:
<ul>
<li>The R session is asserted to be interactive <em>via</em> <code class="calibre2">R_Interactive</code>.</li>
<li><code class="calibre2">.Platform&#36;GUI</code> is set to <code class="calibre2">&quot;AQUA&quot;</code>. That has consequences:
<ul>
<li>The environment variable <code class="calibre2">DISPLAY</code> is set to ‘:0’ if not already set.</li>
<li>/usr/local/bin is appended to <code class="calibre2">PATH</code> since that is where <code class="calibre2">gfortran</code> is installed.</li>
<li>The default HTML browser is switched to the one in <code class="calibre2">R.app</code>.</li>
<li>Various widgets are switched to the versions provided in <code class="calibre2">R.app</code>: these include graphical menus, the data editor (but not the data viewer used by <code class="calibre2">View()</code>) and the workspace browser invoked by <code class="calibre2">browseEnv()</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>grDevices</strong> package when loaded knows that it is being run under <code class="calibre2">R.app</code> and so informs any <code class="calibre2">quartz</code> devices that a Quartz event loop is already running.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The use of the OS’s <code class="calibre2">system</code> function (including by <code class="calibre2">system()</code> and <code class="calibre2">system2()</code>, and to launch editors and pagers) is replaced by a version in <code class="calibre2">R.app</code> (which by default just calls the OS’s <code class="calibre2">system</code> with various signal handlers reset).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If either R was started by --gui=aqua or R is running in a terminal which is not of type ‘dumb’, the standard output to files stdout and stderr is directed through the C function <code class="calibre2">Rstd_WriteConsoleEx</code>. This uses ANSI terminal escapes to render lines sent to <code class="calibre2">stderr</code> as bold on <code class="calibre2">stdout</code>.</li>
<li>For historical reasons the startup option <code class="calibre2">-psn</code> is allowed but ignored. (It seems that in 2003, ‘r27492’, this was added by Finder.)</li>
</ul>
